# Building Detection with Deep Learning MLP model - Taichung case


Building detection in satellite imagery is crucial in city management. It is one of the key pieces of information related to Population and Economics, and is fundamental to urban planning and spatial policy making.

This project is able to turn satellite images to building footprints. Here adopt a Deep learning model, MLP model. Then tuning the hyper-parameter, to reduce the overfitting problems. Then check the accuracy and predict. Finally, this model achieves over 95%.
